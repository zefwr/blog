of all persuasions agree that the financial state of our higher
education is dire. Perusing social media will provide you with
countless posts from its mass of angry supplicants. Parents continue
to implore their children to attend college, even while they wince at
the thought of the cost. Students continue to follow the guidance of
their elders, only to gradually embitter themselves as they come to
understand the financial hole that they’ve goose-stepped into. In
many ways the quality of our education is degenerating as well, but
while quality and cost are by no means unrelated, today I will be
addressing why the bill is so high. We can complain about gender

order to understand the current situation surrounding student debt
and the soaring tuition at American colleges, I would like us to
consider another financial debacle that many in the States are
intimately familiar with: the Housing Crash of 2008. Most people are
similarly confused by the cause of this particular crash, and at the
risk of biting off more than I can chew, I think comparing and
contrasting these two “markets” might leave you with a better
understanding of both than might be obtained one at a time. I would
argue that, while different in many important ways, there is a
chilling similarity between the situation surrounding the higher
education market today, and the housing market in the years leading
up to the ‘08 crash.</font></font></font></p>

2008 the US economy ground to a resounding halt. An elaborate
financial house of cards that had been under construction for some
twenty years finally fell over, and brought the average American down
with it. Homes were foreclosed. Employees were fired. Pension and
retirement funds dried up, and by the time all was said and done,
trillions of dollars had been vaporized in the chaos.</font></font></font></p>

origins of the Housing Bubble have been contentiously debated by
many. Many blame some combination of the “Free Market” (storm
clouds approaching) and “Deregulation” (spooky background music).
Throw that in a pot with some “Evil Capitalists and Bankers” and
you can crash the economy. As we’ll see, however, the housing crash
was precipitated first and foremost by bad underlying mortgage loans,
and these loans were incentivized by government policy, some federal
and some local, in order to solve the “affordable housing crisis.”

Dr. Thomas Sowell says, there are no solutions. There are only
trade-offs. Making housing “affordable” to more people of lower
incomes may sound benevolent, but you cannot wave a magic wand and
make it so. Policy decisions are often made in this wand-waving
fashion, but you do not evaluate policies based on their intentions,
you evaluate them based on their effects. The following are what I
believe to be the major policies that led to the housing crash.</font></font></font></p>

artificially low interest rates, which stemmed from the chronically
low Federal Funds Rate, allowed banks to offer mortgages at below

lenders to offer lower monthly payments, which made it possible for
more low-income earners to qualify for loans. Additionally, it
allowed middle and high-income earners to afford </span></span></font></font></font></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><i><b>bigger

federal and state lawmakers introduced legislation and applied
political and economic pressure to lenders over the years to make
home ownership easier to attain for low-income individuals through
both punitive and remunerative measures. Banks were given quotas of
low-income and minority borrowers to meet, and if they did not could
be subject to discrimination lawsuits, have mergers and other
business transactions denied, </font></font></font>

on these securities than the value of their underlying assets (the
actual home mortgages) with the expectation that if the assets
themselves failed, the government would step in and bail out the

does this relate to student loans? You might consider education and
homes vastly different investments, and you’d be right. Both
require large sums to purchase, but one is collateralized and the
other is not. If you default on your mortgage, the bank can always
seize your house and recoup some or all of their initial investment.
If, however, you default on your student loans, there is nothing
tangible for the bank to seize. The loan is only as viable as the
productive skills and experiences it provides to the student, who
must guarantee it with a share of his presumably higher productivity
into the future.</font></font></font></p>

Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) was enacted by congress in the
eponymous year, and brought the federal government into the business
of incentivizing people to attend college. They did this by
instituting new programs to create conditional grants and
scholarships directly to students and qualifying schools, and
allowing private lenders to issue loans under “student-friendly
terms.” The liability for these loans would be absorbed by the
government, thereby assuming the debt in case of default. The act has
been reintroduced and greatly expanded numerous times, including in
1998 and 2015, increasing the funding and adding new programs to
further incentivize collegiate involvement, especially focusing on
underprivileged minority groups.</font></font></font></p>

may be a purely cynical calculation on the part of many, but I’ll
assume the best of those involved and say that most of these
politicians simply believe that college is a blanket good, no matter
the cost. Unfortunately, this approach ignores the realities of
higher education. Again, no solutions, only trade-offs. In an
abstract sense, going to college in and of itself does not imbue one
with the power to succeed. In lowering the barrier for entry by
making money for school so easy to come by, all people are
incentivized to take advantage of the program. In the end, just like
the housing market, you end up with the education version of bad
mortgages, namely lowered educational standards and nearly useless
degrees. </font></font></font>

to bloat the number of new degree programs and the administrative

giving a mortgage to someone with poor credit is likely to lead to
default, giving out blank checks to aimless children, most of whom
have no experience managing money or debt, is a recipe for low

the lead-up to the housing crisis, the FED gradually ratcheted
interest rates down below market rates (at some points literally
below 0% when accounting for inflation) in order to stimulate the
buying of houses. This led to the lending of so many subprime loans
that the entire market collapsed under their weight; a not so classic
example breaking the link between supply and demand by the
destruction of the price mechanism.</font></font></font></p>

more and more of the student loan market has been absorbed by the
government, an ever-larger portion of these loans have terms dictated
not by market forces, but by politicians and bureaucrats. These
politicians are incentivized to make the loans available to the
widest number of people at the lowest possible rate they can in order
to gain voting support, throwing money into all the open hands they
can find. This means creating programs that make loans at lower than
market rates, and then portraying higher education favorably so that
the highest number of possible voters will utilize the program
they’re responsible for. </font></font></font>

most federally owned loans have interest rates between 4% and 7%,
while private loans range wider, between 2% and 14%, but with a much
higher average rate of 10.4% in 2019. It is reasonable to assume that
the average federal loan interest rate is well below the market rate
for the average student.  Additionally, in an unprecedented move, the
Trump administration froze federal loan repayment in March 2020 in
step with the rest of the pandemic response. After the succession of
the Biden administration, this program was continued indefinitely,
resulting in de facto 0% loans (again, below 0% when accounting for
inflation). Falsely low interest rates lead to higher demand for
credit and increased overall prices as seen in the housing bubble,
and student loans have and will continue to follow suit.</font></font></font></p>

administrators will not hesitate to increase prices when federal
loans continue to support their largess. Since 1977 the average cost
of college tuition has risen by a yearly 6.28%, nearly doubling the

Mae and Freddie Mac owned trillions in mortgage bonds by the start of

had the government not stepped in to guarantee their debts, the
results would have been cataclysmic for those invested in the housing
market. While Fannie and Freddie were not technically part of the
government, they were Government Sponsored Entities (GSEs), private
businesses that were created and supported by congress. It was
unlikely that the government would allow them to fail, which allowed
all lenders and financial firms depending upon their purchasing
mortgage debt to completely ignore the inherent risks of the terrible

time the HEA, and other legislation built upon it, has led to the

and holding student debt itself. In fact, as of 2021 55-60% of all
students who attend higher education receive loans with an average
debt at graduation of $26,000-$36,000, and 93% of all student loans
are owned directly or subsidized by the federal government. This adds
up to about $1.6 trillion in debt, of which the Biden administration

Many disregard it, but there is good research to support this idea.
In 2017 the Federal Reserve issued a staff report of a study they
conducted which indicated that for every dollar of subsidized student
loans given to colleges, the cost of tuition increased by sixty
cents. A smaller but significant effect was observed with
unsubsidized loans as well. Other studies have found similar effects
from Pell grants. In quarter 3 of 2022 there is 291.9$ billion in
outstanding subsidized federal student debt. This means colleges
around the US collectively will have increased the total cost of
tuition by 175$ billion dollars simply due to the existence of these
loans.</span></span></font></font></font></span></p>

in combination with the freezing of interest accrual, is effectively
a doubling down on the bad incentives of the last half century.
Students will find loans even more attractive as the current federal
trend indicates that they may not have to pay them in the end. Why
consider economical majors or career paths other than college?
Allocating time and money to inefficient degrees and schools will
continue as cost is not a concern. Lenders, public and private, will
continue to dole out trillions to schools. Why would they be more
cautious when they’ll eventually be reimbursed by the taxpayer
regardless of the quality of their loans? Schools will continue to
increase tuition prices, hire more administrators, build ever larger
recreational complexes, and create less and less practical
departments and degrees. After all, the great mass of teenagers will
be flushed with government funds to disperse where they wish, and
they must find ways to make themselves attractive to this notoriously
unerudite demographic. Why would the collegiate financial aid office
advise a student to pick a more practical major, or at least save
some money to make a down payment before starting school? Their job
is to sign up as many students as possible. </font></font></font>

the blame for the fiasco at the feet of capitalism. It has been the
general view of most that at the very least, these financial
instruments that were used to spread risk around ended up causing
further destruction, though there are a number of dissenters to this
opinion. Either way, bad loans were the primary underlying problem
with these instruments. However, a similar situation has arisen with
student loans as was seen with mortgages. </span></span></font></font></font></span>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Student
debt is being packaged into Student Loan Asset Backed Securities
(SLABS). These SLABS are analogous to MBSs, yet exhibit some even
worse features than their predecessor. Similar to MBS, SLABS consist
of many student loans packaged together, shares of which are then
sold to investors as lines of stable, fairly risk-free profit. A key
difference between these two securities lies in their underlying
asset. Mortgages are a collateralized form of debt. If you default on
your mortgage, the bank can seize your home and recoup some of their
losses. Student loans, however, are usually not collateralized.
Education ideally, though often no longer in practice, leads to the
development of human capital, but not to any physical asset that
could be repossessed. In cases of default, investors shoulder the
risk of much greater losses. These losses are again much more
damaging to any higher-level securities they underlie.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Currently,
Direct Federal loans, which are the majority of federal student loans
owned by the Department of Education, are not allowed to be
securitized unless refinanced as private debt. In this way, market
exposure due to SLABS is limited to private student loans and FFELs.
Federal Family Education Loans (FFELs)are those made by private
investors, but guaranteed in case of default by the federal
government. Private loans are around 136$ billion, and FFELs are
around 214$ billion. The scale here is certainly smaller than the
trillions involved in the mortgage securities market, however the
underlying assets are similarly unsustainable as we’ve discussed.
Additionally, since such a large portion of these securities are
backed directly by the government instead of indirectly as with
Fannie and Freddie in ‘08, the government has an even more
pronounced conflict of interest. Companies that own these federally
guaranteed loans will be unfairly advantaged over their competitors,
and, as in all these situations, corruption and fraud will be
rampant.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Most
Americans seem to believe this cycle can be repeated ad infinitum. A
similar thought was purveyed by the proponents of the policies that
inspired the housing bubble. I am not proposing that the same type of
economic crash will result from the education market as did from the
housing market. The scale of the markets, the way the loans behave,
the interest rates, and the level of government exposure are all
somewhat different. However, the general trend through both is the
enormous market distortions created by government policy. As was
shown in the housing market, when the government finds a solution,
what results will be a worsening of that problem or the creation of
new, unforeseen problems.</font></font></font></p>
