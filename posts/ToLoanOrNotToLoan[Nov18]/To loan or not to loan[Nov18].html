<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">TO LOAN OR NOT TO
LOAN</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Bill:</b>  I
would like a loan please.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Banker:</b> What
for?</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Bill:</b>  I’m
kinda bored and so I thought I might go to college.  The closest one
is Ramen University and it’s VERRRRRY expensive but I hear it’s a
real party college!</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Banker:</b> What
do you plan on studying while at this other town&gt;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Bill:</b>  Oh, I
have no idea.  Dad just said I needed to get out of the house and
this is one way to do it.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Banker:</b>  What
job do you have and how much money have you put aside for these
education expenses?</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Bill:</b>  Well,
I’ve never actually had a job, unless you count doing the dishes
occasionally for my parents.  But they really didn’t pay much so I
wasn’t able to save any.  Besides, I don’t like doing dishes
much!</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Banker:</b>  What
job do you plan to have while you’re at college.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Bill:</b>  Well,
while I am studying I can’t be expected to hold down a job at the
same time.  Anyway, that would leave almost no time for partying.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Banker:</b> Hmmm,
you’re making this tough for me.  Do you have any collateral to put
up for the loan?</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Bill:</b>  What’s
collateral?  Oh wait, let me google it.  Let’s see, “running side
by side”.  Huh?  What does that have to do with a loan?</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Banker:</b> Never
mind.  Do you think your parents would co-sign on the loan?</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Bill:</b>  I
don’t think so.  Dad said he didn’t want to have anything to do
with it but if I was going to college there are people that would
give me a loan to do it.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Banker:</b> Well
son, I don’t think I can help you.  You don’t meet any of the
requirements that we typically look at for a loan.  But I happen to
know the financial administrator at Ramen U and I think he can help
you.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Bill:</b>  Hmmm,
why is it he can help me but you can’t?</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Banker:</b> Well
he loans out other peoples’ money, doesn’t have to make a profit
and doesn’t take any responsibility for whether you pay back the
loan or not.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Bill:</b>  Ho,
seems like my kinda guy!</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">And so begins Bills
college journey at Ramen U.  He will find that he CAN get a loan
without underwriting, (no credit check, no qualifications needed at
all), based solely on his desire to go to college and his parents
income.  It’s called a “needs based loan” but Bill doesn’t
actually “need” to go to college, he “wants” to, maybe.  At
least he is responding to all those folks in his life that say, “you
really need a college education to succeed in life”.  And the depth
of his desire and his plan for success for college will never
actually be called into question, reviewed on a periodic basis or
monitored in any way.  Those administering the loans don’t really
care too much because it is other peoples’ money they are handing
out.  The financial counselor at Ramen U will not really question
Bills’ motives because Bill obviously wants to attend there and it
means easy money for the school.  Why would they turn that down? 
It’s also easy for Bill, way too easy.  The counselor will
practically fill out the paperwork for Bill.  He’s not even sure
what he wants to do in college, whether or not he can be successful
or not, and the payback for the loan will be so far in the future, it
almost doesn’t even exist in his mind.  He can forget all his
troubles, forget all his cares, and go to Ramen U.  As J. Wellington
Wimpy would say, “I will gladly pay you tomorrow for a hamburger
today”.</p>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">A lot of discussion
is happening regarding the forgiveness of student loans.  It’s
possible that we really should forgive these loans because I believe
we never should have made the loans in the first place.  I would
rather like to propose that the very giving of the loans in the first
place was a mistake.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Let’s look at some
of the reasons often given for the Higher Education Act of 1965,
which has morphed significantly since it’s inception:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">LBJ’s stated
	reason for the program was that “for the individual, education is
	the path to achievement and fulfillment”.  And more people are
	earning degrees at college.  In 1964 about 10% of eligible US
	citizens earned college degrees.  As of 2019 that figure is about
	30%.  If just getting more people into college is the goal, this has
	worked.<br/>
<br/>

	</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The private
	market is unlikely to provide students with loans at affordable
	terms, largely because the loans are not a good business decision. 
	But of course the government can use other people’s money to make
	bad business decisions.  The average default rate is currently about
	<b>28%-29%, </b>compares to 4%-6% on average for home or auto loans.
	 This default rate is similar to the sub-prime home loans in 2008
	that destroyed the economy for a period of time.<br/>
<br/>

	</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Students are
	usually better off with loans than without them, everything else
	being equal.  Many do get college degrees they might not have
	without the government loans.  Yes, the individual is better off if
	the degree is useful.  We could also just throw money at them and
	they would be “better off” than they were before.  That is not
	the real question.  The real question is: do the people providing
	the funds get a benefit and is that benefit worth the cost.  In
	business this question is answered by the business succeeding or
	failing.  In government programs this question is NEVER answered.  <br/>
<br/>

	</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">More college
	graduates = a better workforce and therefor a boosted economy.  This
	could be true, but again at what cost?  Businesses certainly like
	that the government is spending other people’s money on educating
	their workforce, but is this really where the money should come
	from?<br/>
<br/>

	</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Society is
	better off.  I assume this means that society is better off
	financially.  However this is unclear.  The money for the loans came
	from “society” and 28%-29% of them are not being paid back. 
	There may be gains for individuals that positively affect society
	but it is very difficult to know if there is actual benefit.  If the
	benefit was so great, wouldn’t the direct beneficiaries of the
	loans be able to pay them back?</p>
</ol>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">NOTE:  All of these
same reasons could be used to justify government providing loans to
small businesses.  More small businesses is better for the economy,
the private market would not provide business loans that have a 28%
failure rate, the businesses themselves would be “better off”
because of the easy money and more businesses = more jobs!  (And by
the way, did you realize that the federal government DOES provide
federally backed small business loans through the SBA.  But of course
they often do it very discriminately, and yes, they are easier to get
than a standard bank business loan).</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Here are some
reasons why the government should NOT be providing these loans:</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<ol>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Students are
	over-borrowing and not paying the loans back in large numbers. The
	AVERAGE debt of recent graduates is around $32,000.  Student loan
	debt is skyrocketing.  This is happening because of the ease of and
	lack of requirements to get a loan.  If the loan provided sufficient
	value to the borrower they would be able to pay it back.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

	</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">This program is
	costing much more than expected.  When the government switched to
	“direct” student loans, the CBO predicted that they would save 9
	cents for every dollar lent.  Instead it has cost 8 cents for every
	dollar lent.  A complete financial failure, as would be expected of
	a government program not based on real incentives.<br/>
<img src="To%20loan%20or%20not%20to%20loan%5BNov18%5D_html_fc4cf67943f02904.jpg" name="Picture 4" align="bottom" width="483" height="362" border="0"/>
<br/>
<br/>

	</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">This easy money
	created an increased (and false) demand for college degrees. 
	Colleges and universities expanded their academic programs in the
	arts and humanities to suit students not interested in math and
	sciences.  This has led to many more degrees that have much smaller
	monetary value.  Financially, it makes no sense to take out a
	$165,000 loan for a master’s degree that leads to a job where the
	average annual salary is $38,000—yet thousands of young people are
	making this choice.<br/>
<br/>

	</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">College cost
	have increased astronomically, in large part due to the easy
	availability of government backed loans.  Colleges and universities
	respond to supply and demand incentives just like any other business
	or person.  With the increased availability of easy money came an
	increased demand for degrees.  This resulted in increased prices for
	a college education.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

	</p>
	<li><p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">It is not the
	federal governments business to provide money or loans for
	education.  The constitution does not afford this duty to the
	federal government, no matter how beneficial it may or may not be. 
	In fact they should have no responsibility or hand in education at
	all.  This is one of the many, many, many areas the government has
	taken on that should be left to the many states.<br/>
