   <p>As my American friends tried to sleep on the floor of the tiny church, I slipped my guitar 
from the room in search of a quiet place to play. Our temporary clinic in the Peruvian mountain
village of Chiriaco had run late into the evening. Dragging a stool out onto a dewy patch of grass
just past the front gate, I struck up a quiet song. A few minutes later, several of the church
members who had been helping us with the clinic came out to sit with me. I greeted them in
broken Spanish, they in broken English, and we shared the familiar strain of communication
across language and culture. The pastor Mario held a charango, the ten-stringed traditional
Peruvian instrument, and asked if they could join me.</p>

   <p>After agreeing on an old gospel song we all knew, Mario began strumming chords while I
sang the melody and tried to play along. At first the going was difficult as Mario’s playing was
peculiar to me. Adding emphasis to unorthodox beats, using strumming patterns and chord
voicings I didn't know, we struggled to keep from clashing. As one song flowed into the next,
however, unfamiliarity and dissonance was slowly replaced by a collaborative give and take. We
began to wordlessly trade parts, moving from occupying the melody to weaving graceful
harmony as more people joined in with each song.</p>

<p>Music is wonderful like that. It can be demonstrably alien to you, yet still beautiful. 
It can take elements from totally disparate traditions and make something unique. Whenever I’m the
outsider, I strive to see people and cultures in this way. There is always unexpected beauty to
find, and there is always a way to come together to form something rich and unique that
wouldn’t have happened otherwise. As a student and a physician, I will look for ways to form
connections with peoples from different backgrounds and cultures in order to draw from the
knowledge and experiences that I could never divine on my own.</p>
